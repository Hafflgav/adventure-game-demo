# Camunda Murder Mystery Game
> Code assets in this repository were part of a Camunda Platform 8 demo at CamundaCon 2022 in Berlin and are no longer maintained

In a horrible castle (not too far away from your home) there lived a horrible Duke with his horrible wife and their horrible servants. One morning the Duke was deadâ€“murdered by one of the other horrible people living in the castle.
If you do not solve this murder mystery in time there will be another corpse - it might be even possible that it is yours. Make sure to solve the riddle and support the police!

## Starting up the game
1. Clone the repository
2. Update the **application.properties** files with your Camunda Platform 8 SaaS credentials (or link the workers to a local installation)
    - Adapt the properties in **game-init-worker**
    - and **c8-due-date-connector**
3. Spin up all (three) services

The BPMN models should be automatically being deployed to the engine on startup. If not you can find them in the **game-init-worker** resources folder. 

> **Note**: This project includes [Victor Franca's](https://github.com/francav) hey-duedate project. Updates are not propagated from the maintained project to here. 
> You should definitively check out the official [repository](https://github.com/francav/hey-duedate) if you are interested in due-date calculations across different time-zones. (I have only added the repository here to make the startup experience of the game smoother)

## Playing the Game
Of-course we want to play the game now. Therefore, we need to start an instance. You could either do so via the **Web-Modeler** or by leveraging the gRPC API.
Make sure to upload the BPMN file to the Web-Modeler if you want to start it from there.

Having started an instance you can open up **Tasklist** to work on the User Tasks and **Operate** in order to check on the lifecycle of the process instance. 

For sure this game is not feature complete but I hope you can enjoy it (or even submit some feature or pull requests)!
